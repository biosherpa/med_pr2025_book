  abstract = {Background and Purpose\textemdash Severe upper limb paresis is a major contributor to disability after stroke. This study investigated the efficacy of a new nonrobotic training device, the Sensorimotor Active Rehabilitation Training (SMART) Arm, that was used with or without electromyography-triggered electrical stimulation of triceps brachii to augment elbow extension, permitting stroke survivors with severe paresis to practice a constrained reaching task. Methods\textemdash A single-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted with 42 stroke survivors with severe and chronic paresis. Thirty-three participants completed the study, of whom 10 received training using the SMART Arm with electromyography-triggered electrical stimulation, 13 received training using the SMART Arm alone, and 10 received no intervention (control). Training consisted of 12 1-hour sessions over 4 weeks. The primary outcome measure was ``upper arm function,'' item 6 of the Motor Assessment Scale. Secondary outcome measures included impairment measures; triceps muscle strength, reaching force, modified Ashworth scale; and activity measures: reaching distance and Motor Assessment Scale. Assessments were administered before (0 weeks) and after training (4 weeks) and at 2 months follow-up (12 weeks). Results\textemdash Both SMART Arm groups demonstrated significant improvements in all impairment and activity measures after training and at follow-up. There was no significant difference between these 2 groups. There was no change in the control group. Conclusions\textemdash Our findings indicate that training of reaching using the SMART Arm can reduce impairment and improve activity in stroke survivors with severe and chronic upper limb paresis, highlighting the benefits of intensive task-oriented practice, even in the context of severe paresis.

  abstract = {Objective: To investigate the relationship between the strength of muscles of the affected lower limb and walking speed after stroke. Design: A cross-sectional observational study. Setting: University laboratory. Participants: Stroke survivors (Nϭ60; mean age Ϯ SD, 69Ϯ11y) 1 to 6 years poststroke, able to walk 10m independently without aids. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Maximum isometric strength of 12 muscle groups (hip flexors/extensors, adductors/abductors, internal/external rotators, knee flexors/extensors, ankle dorsiflexors/ plantarflexors, invertors/evertors) of the affected lower limb was measured using hand-held dynamometry. Comfortable walking speed was measured using the ten-meter walk test. Results: Univariate analysis revealed that strength of the hip flexors (rϭ.35, Pϭ.01), hip extensors (rϭ.29, Pϭ.03), hip internal rotators (rϭ.30, Pϭ.02), hip adductors (rϭ.29, Pϭ.03), knee extensors (rϭ.27, Pϭ.03), knee flexors (rϭ.30, Pϭ.02), ankle dorsiflexors (rϭ.50, Pϭ.00), ankle plantarflexors (rϭ.29, Pϭ.03), and ankle evertors (rϭ.33, Pϭ.01) were all positively associated with walking speed. Multivariate analysis (nϭ58) revealed that the combined strength of the ankle dorsiflexors and the hip flexors accounted for 34\% of the variance in walking speed (PϽ.001). The ankle dorsiflexors accounted for 31\% of the variance (PϽ.001). Conclusions: The strength of muscle groups other than the lower limb extensors, particularly the ankle dorsiflexors, has an important role in determining walking speed after stroke.},

  year = {2013},
  pages = {11},
  abstract = {Background. Focus of attention is known to play an important role in motor skill learning, yet little is known about how attention is directed within the context of stroke rehabilitation. Objective. The aims of this study were: (1) to identify physical therapists' use of internal and external focus of attention during gait rehabilitation for individuals with hemiplegia following stroke and (2) to use the findings to design an experimental study examining the impact of focus of attention on learning poststroke. Design. The study design involved direct nonparticipation observation of physical therapy treatment sessions. Methods. Eight physical therapy treatment sessions, in which gait rehabilitation was taking place, were video recorded. Patients were aged between 36 and 85 years, and ranged from 7 to 216 days poststroke; physical therapists had between 3 and 12 years of experience in stroke rehabilitation. Data analysis took 2 forms: (1) clear definitions of internal and external focus of attention were agreed on via a consensus group and used to develop an analysis matrix through which incidences of instruction and feedback were identified, categorized, and counted; and (2) verbal dialogue was transcribed verbatim and transcripts were thematically analyzed to provide a detailed description of how instructions and feedback were used, illustrated by examples. Results. The use of instructions and feedback (internal and external focus) was high; an average of one verbal instruction or feedback statement was delivered every 14 seconds. Sixty-seven percent of the statements were internally focused, 22\% were externally focused, and 11\% were of mixed focus. Unfocused statements (eg, ``good'') also were used regularly. Patients were frequently encouraged to ``think about'' their performance. L.

This disadvantage is now moot, as software to facilitate unconditional tests has been available for years. Moreover, Fisher's exact test with mid-p adjustment gives about the same results as an unconditional test. Consequently, several better tests are available, and the choice of a test should depend only on its merits for the application involved.

A statistic UUU depending on the relative ranks of the xxx's and yyy's is proposed for testing the hypothesis f=gf=gf = g. Wilcoxon proposed an equivalent test in the Biometrics Bulletin, December, 1945, but gave only a few points of the distribution of his statistic. Under the hypothesis f=gf=gf = g the probability of obtaining a given UUU in a sample of nx{${'}$}snx{${'}$}sn x's and my{${'}$}smy{${'}$}sm y's is the solution of a certain recurrence relation involving nnn and mmm. Using this recurrence relation tables have been computed giving the probability of UUU for samples up to n=m=8n=m=8n = m = 8. At this point the distribution is almost normal. From the recurrence relation explicit expressions for the mean, variance, and fourth moment are obtained. The 2rth moment is shown to have a certain form which enabled us to prove that the limit distribution is normal if m,nm,nm, n go to infinity in any arbitrary manner. The test is shown to be consistent with respect to the class of alternatives f(x){$>$}g(x)f(x){$>$}g(x)f(x) {$>$} g(x) for every xxx.},

Its exact alternative is the test of Birch, which has recently been reconsidered by Jung. Both tests have a conditional origin: Pearson's chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test, respectively. But both tests have the same drawback that the result of global test (the stratified test) may not be compatible with the result of individual tests (the test for each stratum). In this paper, we propose to carry out the global test using a multiple comparisons method (MC method) which does not have this disadvantage. By refining the method (MCB method) an alternative to the Mantel-Haenszel and Birch tests may be obtained. The new MC and MCB methods have the advantage that they may be applied from an unconditional view, a methodology which until now has not been applied to this problem. We also propose some sample size calculation methods.},

  abstract = {Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan builds readers' knowledge of and confidence in statistical modeling. Reflecting the need for even minor programming in today's model-based statistics, the book pushes readers to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This unique computational approach ensures that readers understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in their own modeling work.  The text presents generalized linear multilevel models from a Bayesian perspective, relying on a simple logical interpretation of Bayesian probability and maximum entropy. It covers from the basics of regression to multilevel models. The author also discusses measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and network autocorrelation.  By using complete R code examples throughout, this book provides a practical foundation for performing statistical inference. Designed for both PhD students and seasoned professionals in the natural and social sciences, it prepares them for more advanced or specialized statistical modeling.  Web ResourceThe book is accompanied by an R package (rethinking) that is available on the author's website and GitHub. The two core functions (map and map2stan) of this package allow a variety of statistical models to be constructed from standard model formulas.},

They followed the Action Observation Treatment rehabilitation program at home with remote supervision by a child neurologist located at the hospital. Outcome measures were the scores at the Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function Scale and the Assisting Hand Assessment. Results: Scores obtained after treatment and at a two months' follow-up significantly differed from baseline and overlapped those obtained in randomized controlled studies carried out in a conventional setting. Conclusions: Action Observation Treatment is therefore a promising approach that can be used on a large scale in a telerehabilitation setting.},

  abstract = {Objective: To determine the effect of action observation (AO) training on the walking ability of patients post stroke. Methods: MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE and PEDro were searched systematically for human studies written in English up to August 31st 2021. Two authors screened titles and abstracts against predefined inclusion criteria; a third author resolved discrepancies. Data were analyzed through qualitative synthesis. Articles evaluating the effects of AO training on the walking ability of patients post stroke were included. Methodological quality was assessed using the PEDro scale. Results: From first search that included 1,578 studies, 7 were included in this review. According to the PEDro scale, most of the studies exhibited a methodological quality between Good and Fair (N {$\frac{1}{4}$} 6). Most of the studies applied a protocol based on a 30-minute training session applied 3 to 5 times per week over a 4-week period (N {$\frac{1}{4}$} 5). Using clinical measures and gait parameters, all studies confirmed the beneficial effects of AO training on walking ability. However, the effects of AO training on walking ability were not confirmed at the long-term follow-up. Conclusions: AO training has a positive effect on the walking ability of patients post stroke. Additional studies are needed to confirm these results across the entire spectrum of patient's post stoke including long-term clinical effects.},

  abstract = {Objective: Among solid tumours, medulloblastoma is the most common of the posterior fossa neoplasms, given that it represents 15\%-20\% of childhood brain tumours. The main aim of the present study was to assess the effects of action observation training on the activities of daily living (ADL) and the manipulation skills of children with acquired brain injury secondary to an oncological process. Methods: We recruited a consecutive convenience sample of 5 patients diagnosed with acquired brain injury secondary to an oncological process. ADL and manipulation skills were assessed using the ABILHAND-Kids and JebsenTaylor Hand Function Test, respectively. After conducting the initial evaluation, we planned the intervention, which lasted 10 weeks and consisted of 40 sessions for each participant, 10 in the occupational therapy department and 30 at home. After completing the intervention, we re-evaluated the main variables. Results: Overall, the results of the postintervention ABILHAND-Kids questionnaire showed a 5-point improvement, with a statistically significant difference and a large effect size. Eighty per cent of the sample showed better results in the total score, with differences between 4 and 8 points. In relation to manual dexterity, as measured by the Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test, there were no significant changes, except in one of the participants. Conclusion: It appears that action observation training can elicit positive changes with respect to the development of ADL, but the influence on manual dexterity was almost nonexistent.},

This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},
